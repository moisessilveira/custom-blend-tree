# custom-blend-tree

This is a custom 3d world space blend tree that allows you to create points in a 2d world space matrix and assign values such as "position" (Vector 3) and "rotation" (Quaternion) or implement new structures or methods for those points.

In this video, you can see the blend tree being used to positioning and rotating a cube around a sphere.
